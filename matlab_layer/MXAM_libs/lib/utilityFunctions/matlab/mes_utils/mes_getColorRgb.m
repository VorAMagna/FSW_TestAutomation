% RGB  Rgb triple for given CSS color name
%
%   RGB = RGB('COLORNAME') returns the red-green-blue triple corresponding
%     to the color named COLORNAME by the CSS3 proposed standard [1], which
%     contains 139 different colors (an rgb triple is a 1x3 vector of
%     numbers between 0 and 1). COLORNAME is case insensitive, and for gray
%     colors both spellings (gray and grey) are allowed.
%
%   RGB CHART creates a figure window showing all the available colors with
%     their names.
%
%   EXAMPLES
%     c = rgb('DarkRed')               gives c = [0.5430 0 0]
%     c = rgb('Green')                 gives c = [0 0.5 0]
%     plot(x,y,'color',rgb('orange'))  plots an orange line through x and y
%     rgb chart                        shows all the colors
%
%   BACKGROUND
%     The color names of [1] have already been ratified in [2], and
%     according to [3] they are accepted by almost all web browsers and are
%     used in Microsoft's .net framework. All but four colors agree with
%     the X11 colornames, as detailed in [4]. Of these the most important
%     clash is green, defined as [0 0.5 0] by CSS and [0 1 0] by X11. The
%     definition of green in Matlab matches the X11 definition and gives a
%     very light green, called lime by CSS (many users of Matlab have
%     discovered this when trying to color graphs with 'g-'). Note that
%     cyan and aqua are synonyms as well as magenta and fuchsia.
