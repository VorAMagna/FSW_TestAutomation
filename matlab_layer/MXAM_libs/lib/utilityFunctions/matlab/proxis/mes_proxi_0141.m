%% Port block location in Simulink models
%
% [result, cr_items, r_stats] = mes_proxi_0141(system, cmd_s, reg, s_regerr)
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% ==================
% A) Inports should be placed on the left side of the Simulink workspace
% and aligned top to bottom.
% Exception: For models with large numbers of subsystems, blocks should be
% arranged in a regular matrix structure with inports aligned vertically.
%
% B) Outports should be placed on the right side of the Simulink workspace
% and aligned top to bottom.
% Exception: For models with large numbers of subsystems, blocks should be
% arranged in a regular matrix structure with outports aligned vertically.
%
% C) The trigger, enable or action block must be located at the top left
% of the subsystem.
% If the subsystem is both triggered and enabled, the enable block must be
% the left most block.

% Regarding a detailed documentaion of this proxi look into the
% documentation of the check, which calls this proxi.
