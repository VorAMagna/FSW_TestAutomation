% =====================
% Signal Naming and Propagation
% MES Functional Safety Guidelines
% Release 1.7 (21 June 2013)
% Corresponding Guideline: 2.1
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% ============
% Each output signal of a subsystem must be named at its source signal.
% That signal name must then be propagated to the Outport block.
%
% PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
% ===================
% The check analyzes each signal line in the model.
%    - Failed 1: The signal originates from a source block, it is not named
%                at the source block, and the source block is not listed in 
%                the check parameter SDT.sc006.BlacklistSourceBlocks.
%    - Failed 2: The signal does not originate from a source block, 
%                and the signal name is not propagated through the chain, 
%                or it is named again.
% The check result is passed if all failed cases do not apply.
%
% exceptions:
%    1. Library blocks are considered as source blocks in the model,
%    irrespective of global parameter setting in 'FollowLinks'.
%    
%    2. When global parameter 'FollowLinks' is set to 'on', the Library
%    blocks are analyzed as an independent entity, which means that the
%    signal name and propagation is verified within the boundary of each
%    Library block.
%
% SOLUTION:
% =========
%     Solution 1: Explicitly name the signal at the source block.
%     Solution 2: For subsequent signal lines in the chain, set the
%     property "Show propagated signals" to "on".
%
% FIX OPERATION:
% ==============
% Follow these steps to repair:
% 
%    1. Sort the failed messages in the 'Findings' section of the Report
%    perspective.
%    
%    2. Manually fix the failed messages which is to name the signals from
%    source blocks.
%    
%    3. Delete any other signal names in the subsequent signal lines after
%    the named signal from the source block.
%    
%    4. Apply autofix, which sets the signal property "Show propagated
%    signals" of the subsequent signals to 'on'.
% 
% Note: In some cases, the number of failed messages may differ from the
% number of repaired messages. This is because the repair action of setting
% the property 'Show propagated signals' to 'on' in the complete signal
% chain from source to destination would have fixed other failed cases.
%
% CHECK PARAMETERS:
% =================
% -SDT.sc006.BlacklistSourceBlocks: A list (cell array) of pairs that
% 	specifies the blocks which are not source blocks. Each pair defines a
% 	block type and a mask type string. The check ignores these user
% 	blacklisted blocks and search further for the source blocks.
